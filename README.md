# AlgorithmsAid
This is part one of a six part project to make learning algorithms simpler for undergraduate students
taking an algorithms course. The Finished project will be a website with various algorithmic concepts
that I've discovered were difficult for students after completing an end of course survey for an
Algorithms & Data course at Northeastern University.
