# AlgorithmsAid
This is part one of a six part project to make understanding concepts in an intro to algorithms course simpler for undergraduate students; or anyone interested in the topic. The Finished project will be a computer application,
a website, and finally a phone application for both iOS and Android devices. These applications will covert various algorithmic concepts that I've discovered were difficult for students after completing an end of course survey for an Algorithms & Data course at Northeastern University.
