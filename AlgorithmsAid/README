*****ALGORITHMS AID********
For this project I will try to use as few built in methods as possible so that people
can better understand the logic behind the code.

I will be creating Models for multiple Heaps such as: MinHeap, MaxHeap, B-Tree, Fibonacci heap,
Reb-Black Tree, Splay Tree, and Binomial Heap.

I will be creating Views for all the Heaps that will abstract from a Generic View used by all the models.

I will be creating a Controller so that the user can play around with the models in the view.

My goal is to get this aid in as many platforms as possible. This is part 1
