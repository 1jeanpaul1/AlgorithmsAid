MinMaxHeapImpl:

MinHeap:

Insertion: When inserting nodes into MinHeap you want to make sure that inserted node's value is less than
it's (the inserted node's) parents node.

MaxHeap:

Insertion: When inserting nodes into MaxHeap you want to make sure that inserted node's value is greater than
it's (the inserted node's) parents node.

Note: As you can tell from reading the above there are a lot of duplicate words. The only different being the
name of the Heap as well as "greater"(for MaxHeap) and "less" (for MinHeap). You should try to avoid code
duplication as much as possible if it can be avoided. Which is why I implemented the functionality
of both MinHeap and MaxHeap into the same class (MinMaxHeapImpl)


Modes:

There are two modes that can be implemented and print out the ordered node data in the console.

Regular Mode:

This will print the data of the inserted nodes

Parent Mode:

This will print the data of the inserted nodes along with data about the parent node.
